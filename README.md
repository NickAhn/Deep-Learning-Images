# Deep Learning Images
This course was a Independent Study on Deep Learning with Convolutional Neural Networks.

# What is independent study?
Independent Study (COMP191A) is a course offered by the School of Engineering and Computer Science at the 
University of the Pacific where students study and research on a unique topic alongisde an appointed
professor that has experience in the topic. <br> 


# Motivation
I have taken an interest in Machine Learning, more specifically neural networks, after taking an Artificial Intelligence course at UOP.
The way that machines can learn from unsupervised learning through backpropagations was fascinating, and I wanted to see what couuld be accomplished
with deeper networks. So after some discussions with [Ramon Arambula](https://github.com/RamonAra209) and [Ethan Coe-Renner](https://github.com/ethan-coe-renner),
we decided to pursue our collective interest in Neural Networks by taking an independent study under under our professor/academic advisor
[Dr. Sepephr Amir-Mohammadian](https://engineering.pacific.edu/engineering/directory/amir-mohammadian-sepehr).
